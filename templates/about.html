  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <h3>The idea behind the school</h3>
  <p>We begin with three core premises:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning is hard</li>
      <li>Learning <b>alone</b> is <i>really</i> hard</li>
      <li>Some skills are not taught in school</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that these skills are essential. Hence the goal of <b>hackerschool</b> is to make learning easier by getting people past the initial hurdle of learning these skills.
  </p>

  <h3>The endstate</h3>
  <p>
    We are starting small. With only a few courses. Yet, we are dreaming <b>big</b>. As we get better and fine tune existing workshops, we'll continue to grow and add to the number of courses. The hope is to ultimately have a comprehensive list of courses that incoming freshman and <i>all nus students</i> can look forward to and take part in. The hope is to teach them stuff outside of the typical curriculum.
  </p>

    <b>The hope is to get more people to hack.</b>
